# Pechenga Casino and Resort Demo App

This app represents about 8 hours of actual work and is meant to demonstrate my skills.  I decided to reign myself in after a full day.  Most of my time was spent on playing with my app logic.

1. Familiarity with NodeJS

In this demo, I had some fun creating a proxy class around Express to wire up routes, etc, using convention-based rules:
  - Paths are based on controller names + method names
  - Controller lifespan is limited to a single request
  - Provides a super basic dependency injection container

2. Familiarity with Node Express

Some light use of Express routing, middleware, etc.

3. Familiarity with HashiCorp Vault

Installed a new Vault service instance on one of my local VMs, created a KV storage instance, Penchenga role, policy, etc.
